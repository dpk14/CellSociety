## Introduction

The primary design goal for this project is to create abstractions of
the subsystems that could be easily manipulated to make the entire
program as modular as possible.

We plan to have the simulation be closed, so that the algorithm for
each simulation is contained in one place. Each cell will keep its
own grid position to take the work away from the simulation.
